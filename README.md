# Sentiment Analysis Machine Learning Model 

This is a project to build a machine learning engine for analyzing sentiment in text 

The goal is to sue natural language processing and deep learning techniques to assign sentiment polarity labels (positive, negative, neutral) to input text.

The finished project will include training data, models and a real time web app for predictions

## Getting Started 

### Install 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Brandon-G-Tripp/sentiment-analysis
